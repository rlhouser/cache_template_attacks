# Cache Template Attack Demo

This repository contains a toy example to demonstrate the cache template attack described in "[Cache Template Attacks: Automating Attacks on Inclusive Last-Level Caches](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity15/sec15-paper-gruss.pdf)" (2015). The core of the code here derives from a fork of a repository (https://github.com/IAIK/cache_template_attacks) created by one of the authors of this paper.

The cache template attack is itself based on another work: "[FLUSH+RELOAD: a High Resolution, Low Noise, L3 Cache Side-Channel Attack](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity14/technical-sessions/presentation/yarom)" (2014). 

This repository was developed as part of an initiative to develop hands-on labs to allow undergraduate and graduate students to learn the dynamics of attacks based on shared resources and aimed at informaiton leakage.
